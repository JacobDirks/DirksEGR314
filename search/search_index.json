Most of the team desires to use ESP32 due to experience through personal projects. This alone is not a strong enough reason to use it, but is a good starting point. For this project I'll need at least 1 spi terminal since I can daisy chain the motor controller. I would like an i2c communication port or UART to communicate with other boards. In terms of my full responsibilities, I need to receive information regarding the direction to move the submarine and then communicate that information to the specific motors. Now an important statement to know for not pursuing a pic at this point is that the motor controller was not working during the lab that was using a pic. It didn't work on either of the pics I attempted nor those of my classmates and teammates attempted.</p> <p>Below are images support this decision and here is the \"Datasheet\"</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>There are enough pins that I can use the UART port as well as the SPI port or I2C port as I see fit while build the rest of the design.
