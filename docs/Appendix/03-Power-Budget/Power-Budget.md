title: Appendix - Power Budget
---

## Overview

Here we took the main components of our subsystem found their maximum current, placed a safety margin and then checked to see if the supply would be able to handle that. If the supply can't handle it then we will need to return to the component selection and pick a better component.

## Conclusions

From the prepared Power Budget, we will need to change the switching regulator or gather clarification on if they want true maximum current since most of the current draw would be from unused modules. We will likely need 2 or more power adapters otherwise we will not be able to safely operate this module.
