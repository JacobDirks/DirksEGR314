title: Module's Selected Microcontroller

 ## **Team Responsibilities**

For this project I am in charge of the drive train, This means that I will need to control 3 DC motors at the minimum and toggle their outputs based on the communication from a teammates board. 

 ## **Microcontroller Section**

The choice is between a pic or the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 for a surface mount controller. Most of the team desires to use ESP32 due to experience through personal projects. This alone is not a strong enough reason to use it, but is a good starting point. For this project I'll need at least 1 spi terminal since I can daisy chain the motor controller. I would like an i2c communication port or UART to communicate with other boards. In terms of my full responsibilities, I need to receive information regarding the direction to move the submarine and then communicate that information to the specific motors. Now an important statement to know for not pursuing a pic at this point is that the motor controller was not working during the lab that was using a pic. It didn't work on either of the pics I attempted nor those of my classmates and teammates attempted.

Below are images support this decision and here is the ["Datasheet"](resources/pdf/esp32.pdf)

There are enough pins that I can use the UART port as well as the SPI port or I2C port as I see fit while build the rest of the design. There may be a bit of a challenge soldering in the surface mounted pins so I might have to rely on fewer connection points until everything is tested to work and then I can polish the build.
