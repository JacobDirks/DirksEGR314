## Module's Selected Major Components

The following sections are the selected major components necessary for the drivetrain subsystem.

<!--
### Actuator

(**remove this note/placeholder**: if applicable, this is where your **Selected** the actuator items go, which includes both the driver and motor. Otherwise, remove this section.)

For more details, review the ["Appendix - Component Selection Process - Actuator"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR314DataSheetTemplate/Appendix/01-Componet-Selection/Component-Selection-Process/#actuator) selection.
-->

**Chosen Actuator**:

I will choose ["2. Brushed DC Motor Standard 11605 RPM 5VDC"](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nmb-technologies-corporation/PAN14EE12AA1/2417070) for this project. This motor adds the least amount of weight which is better for watercraft. Secondarily it operates within the motor driver to ensure successful electrical manipulation. This motor also ensures an easier way to mount the motor which helps prevent catastrophic failure during operations.

**Chosen Actuator Driver**:

I will choose option ["1. IC HALF BRIDGE DRIVER 6A 12DSO](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/infineon-technologies/IFX9201SGAUMA1/5415542) for this project. Due to the knowledge built in the labs and the ability to daisy chain while keeping prices low this option becomes ideal. Furthermore, we are able to meet project requirements with one and if needed bypass it for the other two motors. Creating a backup that might be particularly necessary during a quick project sprint.

### Power Management

**Chosen Voltage Regulator 3.3V Line**:

I will choose option ["4. IC REG BUCK 3.3V 2A TSOT23-6"](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/diodes-incorporated/AP63203WU-7/9858426) for this project. It offers channels that I can use to successfully to get the 3.3v line powered with some extra current to allow for additional features like RC Servos. This will in turn help the project respond in more intuitive ways while providing a decent part with a reduced budget requirement. Furthermore, it does meet project requirements.

**Chosen Voltage Regulator 5V Line**:
I will choose option ["5. IC REG BUCK ADJ 2.5A 20HTSSOP"](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/LM5005MHX-NOPB/1871800) for this project. It is not ideal to have 2 regulators selected for the project but it does help while reducing costs. This also allows us to meet the project requirements and power budget requirements for my sub module.
