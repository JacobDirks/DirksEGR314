## Module Requirements
For this project I'm focusing on the drive system to ensure the overall submarine can move.  

| **Requirement Description** | **Measure of<br> Threshold** | **Target<br>Measure** |**Stretch<br>Requirement<br>(Y-N)**|
|-----------------------------| ----------------- | ----------------- | :-----: |
| Surface mounted, 3.3V switching power regulator | 3.2 Volts | 3.3 Volts | No |
| Surface mounted micro-controller | 1 PIC or ESP | 8-bit PIC | No |
| Wireless Communication | Able to send or receive a Wi-Fi data | Send and receive Wi-Fi Data to MQTT | Yes |
| Motor driver for control of direction and speed  | H-bridge circuit for at least 3 DC Motors | PWM or more efficient circuit for at least 3 DC Motors | No |
| Motor for controlled movement | 2 side mounted DC motors and one rear mounted DC motor | DC Motors with axial control for finessed control | No |
| Shared Power rail | 6 volts | 12 volts | No |
| Motors need to be able to move the robot and keep it afloat. | 0.5 mph | 1.5 mph | No |
